- **Key Topics**:
  - Firing angle control and its effects on power and current waveforms.
  - Harmonic analysis of load voltage and current.
  - Reactive power analysis for industrial heating systems.

### Lab 2: AC-DC Converters
- **Objective**: Explore the steady-state and transient performance of three-phase diode and thyristor-based AC-DC converters.
- **Key Topics**:
  - Comparison of diode and thyristor rectifiers in terms of performance indices.
  - Harmonic analysis and power factor evaluation.
  - Transition modes in thyristor rectifiers with varying firing angles.

### Lab 3: DC-DC Converters
- **Objective**: Study one-quadrant (buck) and two-quadrant DC-DC converters and their application in DC motor drives.
- **Key Topics**:
  - Duty cycle variation and its effect on motor speed and torque.
  - Regenerative braking and energy recovery in two-quadrant converters.
  - Dynamic response analysis of converters under varying loads.

### Lab 4: DC-AC Inverters
- **Objective**: Investigate single-phase voltage source inverters (VSIs) and Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation (SPWM) techniques.
- **Key Topics**:
  - Comparison of half-bridge and full-bridge inverters.
  - Harmonic analysis of AC and DC waveforms.
  - Effects of over-modulation on waveform quality and efficiency.
